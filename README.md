# Bergen Wireless Sensor Lab

We are a project dedicated to establish a citywide wireless sensor network for R&D purposes. The citywide network will be the lab where students and partners can test software and algorithms.

To succeed with the goal we need to build competence, involve partners and run lots of tests.

In practice we will run several versions of code - some for stability testing, some for experimentation and some for actually collecting real world data.
